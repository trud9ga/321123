							<p>
								The first step to clockwork infrastructure automation is evaluating the possible inconsistencies
								and
								drawbacks. First of all, we review the existing infrastructure setup by evaluating critical
								parameters
								and components of security, scalability, and resource utilization. Most importantly, our team
								analyzes
								infrastructure cost utilization, defines issues, bottlenecks of the current setup and
								configuration.
							</p>
							<p>
								The result of the Infrastructure technical audit is a document that represents our
								recommendations and
								possible improvements that should be implemented to optimize the IT infrastructure functioning.
							</p>
							<p>
								As a result, clients have a full understanding of the current IT infrastructure, infrastructure
								maintenance expenses review, and recommendations and improvements list.
							</p>
							<p>
								Our solutions architect develops the implementation roadmap after the client accepts the
								recommendations.
							</p>
						</div>

						<div class="automated__title _title">Cloud consulting and management</div>
						<div class="automated__text">
							<p>
								Before migrating to the cloud or optimizing the current on-cloud infrastructure, we carefully
								consider the client's business goals. Depending on the objectives, we develop a cloud
								infrastructure optimization plan. It usually consists of the following steps:
							</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Defining current state and problems with cloud setup</li>
								<li>Describing high-level tasks and goals</li>
								<li>Allocating a certified cloud team to work on the project</li>
								<li>Building a roadmap and scope of work</li>
								<li>Launching the implementation and ongoing support</li>
							</ol>
							<p>
								As a result, companies get a full vision of how and why the cloud is implemented and a proper
								cloud
								setup and configuration using the best tools and technologies.
							</p>
							<p>
								Most importantly, by optimizing cloud infrastructure, enterprises improve the cost-efficiency of
								their infrastructure. OpsWorks Co. provides 24/7 DevOps support that ensures maximum uptime and
								availability.
							</p>
						</div>

						<div class="automated__title _title">Physical-to-Cloud/Cloud-to-Physical migration</div>
						<div class="automated__text">
							<p>
								After we have profoundly analyzed the current setup and purposes of migration, the allocated
								team
								selects new hardware provider depending on the tools the client's needs and their availability
								on
								the corresponding cloud platform.
							</p>
							<ol>
								The migration process itself involves several steps:

								<li>Creating new infrastructure architecture design</li>
								<li>
									Preparation of a step-by-step migration plan considering risks and possible downtime
								</li>
								<li>
									Migrating the infrastructure to a new setup by stages (development, stage, and production)
								</li>
								<li>
									New setup testing and evaluation
								</li>
							</ol>
							<p>
								Even though more and more enterprises are adopting cloud solutions, it is only the question of
								the
								business needs. This is why, before offering any solution, we carefully consider the needs of
								the
								business we are cooperating with.
							</p>
							<p>
								As a result, companies get a properly designed and optimized infrastructure, secure and
								compliant
								setup, scripted and documented solution that works efficiently for a certain business model.
							</p>
						</div>

						<div class="automated__title _title">Serverless infrastructure adoption</div>
						<div class="automated__text">
							<p>
								To build resilient serverless infrastructure, we evaluate its components to see if they can be
								migrated to the serverless shell. The components that need design are created directly on top of
								the serverless infrastructure. After all components are ready, we set up the needed
								configuration
								along with such solutions as monitoring, logging, processes automation, etc.
							</p>
							<p>
								To ensure that the infrastructure we built is being taken good care of, we document and test it
								before running a training for the client teams on how to manage it.
							</p>
							<p>
								As a result, clients get a modern, scalable, and cost-efficient infrastructure that corresponds
								to
								your specific enterprise's business needs.
							</p>

						<div class="automated__title _title">Infrastructure as Сode implementation</div>
						<div class="automated__text">
							<p>
								It's not a secret that this year's DevOps trend is automation, and nothing is surprising.
								Automating processes in your IT infrastructure allows teams to eliminate time-consuming manual
								work
								and concentrate on what matters — the product.
							</p>
							<p>
								The team of DevOps engineers at OpsWorks Co. starts with analyzing infrastructure setup and
								resource provisioning to define what can be automated. We define components and assets of the
								infrastructure that can be provisioned as IaC and present our solution to the client. When
								approved
								by the client, we design high-level architecture, develop code for automated infrastructure
								provisioning, and deploying infrastructure IaC-based changes.
							</p>
							<p>
								What client gets when everything is ready is:
							</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Fully-automated infrastructure provisioning</li>
								<li>
									Cloud-agnostic setup
								</li>
								<li>
									Fast environment deployments and infrastructure changes

									Enhanced security and reduced human risk
