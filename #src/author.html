							<p class="author__content">Online shopping makes up one-fifth of the retail economy. E-Commerce
								businesses have
								completely changed the concept of
								shopping. The traditional 'brick-and-mortar' model, which implies face-to-face sales, is
								having difficulties competing
								with web-based shops and platforms like Amazon and AliExpress. The lack of comfort and long
								lines in stores are just two
								of the many reasons that shoppers today are turning to online retailers.</p>


							<p class="author__content">Online businesses stand out because of their high flexibility and low
								operating costs.
								Moreover, online shopping trends
								have changed people's perception of shopping. Online shops often offer free delivery and
								returns, as well as save you
								money and time by avoiding a trip to the store.</p>


							<p class="author__content">Sorry to break it to you, but if your retail business still isn't
								online, you are most likely
								going to lose your
								existing customers and not gain new ones unless you launch a website. Imagine that you decide
								to move your retail
								business online; the first thing that you should understand is that the digital
								transformation takes more than a day or
								even a week. It should be wisely planned and implemented so as not to upset the business
								workflow, continuity, or
								quality.</p>

							<p class="author__content">The milestones of digital transformation include a setup that
								involves
								the initial
								configuration of backup systems,
								network, application development, testing, monitoring and executing processes, and others
								that maintain the production
								cycle. These processes will also require some assistance to make everything work smoothly.
							</p>

							<p class="author__content">The task of a DevOps team is to minimize misunderstandings between
								Development and Operations
								departments and to enable
								the Development team to test and deploy the new versions of applications in a
								straight-forward manner. Hence, DevOps for
								the retail industry is a solution that brings you one step closer to being a strong
								competitor.</p>

							OpsWorks Col. These guys are
							known to do their job pretty good!
